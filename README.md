## Overview
### Description
Displays locations that users mark as interesting, unique, or hidden. Can potentially contain locations and routes that individuals will explore with friends and family.  

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Travel / Social
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users location, and displays marked locations within the users desired vicinity. The user can then decide to mark a new location or view marked locations.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would be showed locations at a maximum of 20 miles away from their current location.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how adventurous they are, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** First we would start with displaying marked locations based on the individual's location preferences, then perhaps this could evolve into a travel guide application as well to broaden its usage.
